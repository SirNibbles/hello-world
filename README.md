# hello-world
Go easy on me fellas

Holy shit, so I'm playing around on GitHub now.
Write about myself? Well I'm a 17 year old male,
I love computers, gaming and coding. I play around
with HTML, Scratch and Delphi. Why am I on GitHub?

I guess it's because I'm trying to further my hacking
skills. Yeah, hacking. I started feeling interested about
2 years ago and only now really focussing on it.

Honestly, if anyone can actually read this, maybe lend me
a hand some time. There's only so much that Youtube can teach me :p
